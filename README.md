# 🌾 Rice Leaf Disease Detection System

An AI-powered **Rice Leaf Disease Detection Web Application** that helps farmers, researchers, and agricultural professionals identify common rice leaf diseases using image analysis and provides **recommended medicines** for treatment.

This project uses **Django** as the backend for disease prediction and **Next.js with React** as the frontend for a modern, responsive user interface.

## 🧠 Project Overview

Rice is one of the most important crops in India and many parts of the world. Leaf diseases can significantly reduce yield and quality if not detected early.

This system allows users to:
- Upload a rice leaf image
- Detect the disease using a machine learning model
- View disease name, confidence level, and treatment recommendations
- Take early action using suggested medicines
